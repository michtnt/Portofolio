      <p class="heading-meta">My Coding Journey</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This is a story of my journey from July 2018 - July 2020 on what I have learnt and experienced so far.</p>
      <h2 class="title">Getting Started</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I started to learn coding on July 2018, which happens to be Python. I started to learn it because I was terrified
        that coding will be difficult for me later when I start to earn my Diploma in IT (October 2018.) so I was thinking
        that maybe I can get a head start on whether I like coding or not. Surprisingly, I loved it a lot! I remember that
        time I even build a simple Python program to take a ramen order. I only manage to learn the base of python (variables,
        conditional, basic data structures, operations) and skipped inheritance and classes because it was too confusing for me that time (I learned it from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">
        Codecademy</a>).
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Problem-solvers</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">After learning Python, around August 2018 I started to learn C++ to solve algorithmic problem (read: competitive
        programming.) from <a href="http://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a>. I had a shock, transitioning from Python to C++
        is weird because how the pattern and syntax are so different. I enjoyed solving problems from codeforces although some
        of them are really hard for me although sometimes when I left it for a couple of weeks I can manage to solve it, the other
        time I just can't pass it (brain not big enough. Haha.). I did this for like 3 weeks I think and took a break from coding
        until Diploma starts.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Diploma Period</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">During my first semester, I learnt the base fundamentals of Java and it was easy for me to understand. I think this is
        because I've learnt Python myself before this so I am familiar with basic programming concepts. On second semester, I need
        to learn Applications Programming subject which is more advanced Java which involves inheritance, classes, more in-depth understanding on objects, 
        Object Oriented Programming pattern, GUI, etc. Honestly, it was hard for me. I often felt like I'm not enough to understand
        these concept that my teacher taught but I kept trying and I give more time to learn about it. The semester is 11-weeks approximately
        so basically I feel like I'm in a race with a train and I just can't keep up with it. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">In the end, I got High Distinction on Applications Programming and got a job as a Peer Tutor (Teacher's Assistant. same thing.)
        for Applications Programming. By the time I graduated, I only understand 50% of Applications Programming concept, when I work as a 
        Peer Tutor, I finally understand the concept that my teacher taught fully.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Break before University</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle">JavaScript</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        So, I got like 3 months of school holiday and I spent that time working and learning UI frameworks, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and MongoDB. Why
        I decide to learn this is because I search for IT jobs in Australia and found out that I don't have any skills in development field.
        I searched for most popular thing that makes people want to hire you and it wasn't surprising to know that I saw so many keywords I
        don't understand. I start from small-steps which is learning JavaScript from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>
        although I wouldn't say I remember what did I learn from there haha. I only went halfway, got bored and decide to jump in React.js directly.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">React.js</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        React.js is basically a JavaScript library to build a dynamic single-page app (my definition.). I decide to learn this and I have bitter
        -sweet experience with it but knowing I'm still motivated to learn about it. The first thing I made was a website that save your to-do lists
        and keep your contacts. I learnt React.js from reading and watching youtube videos. Learning by yourself is truly a great experience and it
        will improve your skills on googling and solving bugs haha. At first, I use a mock data for my web-app until I start to learn Node.js and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Node.js and MongoDB</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Same thing with React.js, I went to youtube and google to learn about it. Node.js and MongoDB are really straightforward, you just need to
        adjust yourself around them and get used on writing code and solving problems. I manage to connect my web-app to server with it and I am happy to
        say that it is my first project where I manage to build something with front-end and back-end together.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">UI Frameworks</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The contact keeper web-app that I made has a very ugly front-end (it looked like websites when your network is bad so it only renders the html.)
        and that's when I realised that there is something called UI frameworks which is in my definition basically it's a built-in UI components for you to use
        in your websites (tl;dr: you don't have to worry a lot about css because they have built-in UI.) and I incorporate React Bootstrap to my web-app and safe
        to say, it looked much more better.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">University Break</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I got an interview for Software Developer internship position in Sydney. I remember I lied about being proficient in React Native (sorry to my 
        employer.) which I am not lol. The day before my internship starts, I watched 4-hours React Native crash course and funny thing is, the first day
        of my internship I was already asked to design the mobile application UI and build it with React Native. I was so terrified because I didn't know
        this would happen and I was in panic because I haven't tried to code with React Native since I only watched the video haha. Anyway, it went okay in
        the end although there's so much pressure at first but after googling a lot of stuff I actually learn a lot in such a short time. I also got a hands-on 
        experience with MongoDB + Node.js and I also used Python to test the API.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">University Starts</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I totally picked the wrong subjects, Apparently 3 out of 4 subjects that I have are programming-related (C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms,
        Java for Introduction to Software Development, Swift for Application Development in ios Environment.) and at work I need to use JavaScript and Python.
        So, safe to say I need to use 4 programming languages in majority for this period. It does stress me a lot but I passed my semester all okay. For
        Data Stuctures and Algorithm I use C++ to solve algorithmic problems, for Introduction to Software Development I use Java to build a Multiple Page Web-Applications
        with Apache Derby as the database and for Application Development in ios Environment I use Swift to develop calculator, bubble-pop game and AR bubble-pop game.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">So Far..</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I could illustrate my journey as this: (I only include those I learnt on my own. I went on Hiatus from Jun 2019 to November 2019
        due to work and school.).
