      <p class="heading-meta">My First Hackathon</p>
      <p class="paragraph">My first Hackathon (organised by Programming Society at uni.) and how our team won 2nd place.</p>
      <h2 class="title">How do I get this opportunity?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
          Back then I am still pursuing my Diploma degree so technically, I haven't went to uni. But this doesn't stop
          me to research about societies and clubs in UTS. I am particulary interested with Programming Society that time
          but I know I need to pay more than five bucks to join the society because I am not a uni student, yet. I happen to
          know a woman that has position in the society and asked her about it when I found out there is Hackathon on their
          facebook. In summary, I can join the Hackathon and I pay for uni students member fee (which is great). 
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">What is Hackathon?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Honestly, back then I don't even know what is Hackathon clearly. I thought it was for 
          IT people competing to see who developed the best product (it was far more than this). Based from Wikipedia, a Hackathon is 
          a design sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, 
          including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate 
          intensively on software projects.

      <h2 class="title">Choosing Team Members</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">There was a meeting the night before the Hackathon starts for you to choose your team members, if I remember it
          correctly there are four role tags (Engineer, Developer, Creative Intelligence (?), Designer) to help us in choosing our team members.
          I got a "Developer" tag that time and I end up finding a great group! (They were all so nice.)
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Establish an Agreement</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Problem</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
       The Hackathon starts the next morning, with one of the judges presenting the problems we need to address. We decide to solve problem
       regarding to the inefficiency of communication between city planners, organisations and their relevant councils. We realised that when 
       inquiring our client, there are three focus points including spam where emails get lost, mis-direction when the relevant people are 
       difficult to get a hold of for new city planners, and a lack of accountability due to lack of documentation and enforcement.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Solution</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We present the NSWGov Central Comms, a centralised communication hub that is specifically for city planning, connecting city planners, 
        organisations and government. It contains a database of relevant e-mails to contact, along with due dates of when to reply. Our vision is 
        that this will speed up the development/process and allow inter-connected designs between city planners and their stakeholders. 
        Others in the market like Jira create collaborative task management. But the value we bring is we tailored this website for city planning. 
        Convenience ease of access to e-mails with concrete messaging, efficiency by categorising messages by types: approval, request, information, 
        and a focus on accountability with read receipts and digital reports.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Future Plans</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Our next steps are improved UX design, group threads m and extending from Greater Sydney to NSW and all of Australia. We know it is ambitious, 
        but what we're looking for is the approval of the Premier Cabinet to implement this, permitting local councils and other goverment organisations 
        to be involved. In improving the flow of communication for city planners, it will allow more effective urban designs for us living in Sydney.

      <h2 class="title">24-Hours Hackathon</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We decided to use JavaScript, Electron, ExpressJS and sqlite3 as the base. I have never learnt any of these beside SQL so I feel so
        useless this time but I pushed myself to learn JavaScript as fast as I could and I helped the team with the database. We pull all-nighters
        and slept for only 3 hours. After we finished, I directly know that I need to learn JavaScript and research about it. We end up winning
        second place! the judges said that it was not the most innovative but it was what they needed to address the problem. 
        I was really proud about it although I really wish I could have helped more. It is still one of the best experience I got.
